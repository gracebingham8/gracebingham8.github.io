<p id="p1">Andre is twenty seven and living in Queens where his days are split between working at a record store and making music. His night are alive, being a DJ in the making, crafting beats in his studio bedroom and throwing undergroung parties.
  <br><br>Restless and ambitious, Andre dreams of breaking into the city's music scene, even as family pressures try to persuade him in other directions. For him, every track is a chanc to turn noise into meaning, making his mark on New York City.  <br><br>He spends his commute times on the train listening and making music, travelling all through New York to perform.
